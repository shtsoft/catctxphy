# catctxphy

The idea of this project is to provide an accessible introduction to category theory. Especially for physicists. So far the project consists of

- notes on category theory titled [Category Theory in the Context of Physics](https://github.com/shtsoft/catctxphy/releases/latest/download/paper.pdf) which if you like you can cite as [.bib-file](https://github.com/shtsoft/catctxphy/releases/latest/download/paper.bib)

## Contributing

If you are dissatisfied with anything or have improvements, ideas or whatever feel free to make a pull request. We are glad about any kind of help.

## TODO

A project is rarely perfect. This one is not an exception and so some things remain to do:

- improve the whole writing according to [Dreyer's notes on writing papers](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~dreyer/talks/talk-plmw16.pdf)
- make notation less heavy in some places
- structure proofs more like programs to ease understanding
- adding examples from computer science from which physicist might benefit:
  - the relation of natural transformation to parametricity (system F)
  - the relation of Yoneda-lemma to continuation-passing-style-transformations
  - the relation of monads to foobar-passing-style
  - the freer monad as further example for Kan-extensions
  - reflective subcategories to understand reflection and reification
  - (co)inductive types
  - topological data analysis
